Project Management Task Manager
This is a bit of software I have been working on for about a day. It is the beginning of a suite of tools I intend to build, so far it consists of a Task Manager for Scrum/Agile teams to keep an up-to-date backlog of tasks. I am still making it "pretty", and newer versions will come in time. Feel free to let me know what you think!
